# Known limits and non-claims

## Tactical Soul Framework is a foundation, not a finished game editor

Implemented: exact-ROM gate, bounded binary access, overlap ledger, aligned
allocation, typed enemy/consumable/weapon/armor/soul/Julius records, native entity/
door serializers and replacement, one actual after-update Thumb hook, independent
native balance/counter examples, callback source-aware compilation, separate ROM
outputs, inspect/build/play commands, emulator harness and documented evidence.

Not implemented: visual level editor; general tilemap/collision/tileset authoring;
complete campaign/map/save compiler; graphics/palette allocator; general AI/item/
soul scripting language; arbitrary safe detours; alternate character engine;
complete animation importer; custom persistence/save migration; regional ports;
hardware certification; automatic patch compatibility; finished companion plugins.

An agent can build full mods on this core through further engineering. Naming an
extension point does not implement it, and every campaign redesign is not already
expressible through JSON. Native table fields are structurally documented but
not individually gameplay-certified. Code pointers require verified ABI-compatible
code. New native entities may need resource provisioning. RAM reservations are
exercised in tested scenes, not certified against every cutscene/ending.

## Mario gaps

Four-room isolated slice replaces the minimap, not a full castle extension.
Corridors reuse Aria architecture and genuine SMA2 sprites. Enemy AI is simplified
original code, not a full SMA2 engine port. Weapon/soul hit rectangles are
approximations; elemental/defense behavior and every ability are not fully modeled.
No stomping, new soul drops or playable Mario. EXP is incremented but native
level-up dispatch remains unverified. Flowers expire on death/quit, last 1200
active frames and do not persist in saves. Enemies/pickups reset on room entry.
Fireballs travel straight without full wall/bouncing physics. Block-top movement,
menus, all equipment/soul combinations and long sessions need broader testing.

Rendering reservations apply to empty native enemy banks in isolated corridors.
Native enemies in those rooms require a resource audit. The sanctuary deliberately
skips companion writes. Slot preservation is not proof of every native ability.

## Distribution and publication

Copied development folders contain private ROMs/generated games. Never share a
whole folder; use allowlist packaging. The existing ROM-free ZIP and Melty recipe
were inspected; revised static one-click check passes. Actual client launch is
untested. Upload was rejected pending explicit permission for that payload and
external Melty storage. Later documentation/copying requests do not authorize
retry. No public publishing is authorized. Tests are not a copyright license.


## Existing-room milestone (2026-10-10)

See [ROOM-DESIGN.md](ROOM-DESIGN.md) for sparse entity moves, paired existing doors, map/save diagnostics, commands, test evidence and extension guidance. `aria/level.py` implements this layer; `examples/room-workshop/mod.json` is its runnable example. General geometry/collision authoring, map relocation and campaign-wide graph repair remain unimplemented; the narrow terrain milestone below is available.

## Weapons/equipment milestone (2026-10-10)

Read [EQUIPMENT.md](EQUIPMENT.md) before equipment work. `aria/equipment.py` adds named selection, signed STR/CON/INT/LCK, preserved unknown flag bits and narrow validated edits. `examples/equipment-workshop/mod.json` is runnable. Native graphics/attack-family changes, new inventory slots and custom item effects remain extension work. The low-level table API stays unsigned.

## Enemy toolkit milestone (2026-10-10)

See [Enemy and encounter guide](ENEMIES.md) for all 113 named records, expected-value balance edits, named item drops, readable flags and conservative same-room moves/clones. `examples/enemy-workshop/mod.json` is playable; `scripts/verify_enemies.py` checks native stats, EXP, a real item drop, encounter traversal and return. Arbitrary AI, species/resource provisioning, soul reassignment and boss/event placement remain extension work.

## Ability milestone D

See [ABILITIES.md](ABILITIES.md) for the implemented native SDK and precise extension contracts. `aria/abilities.py` validates config/RAM/runtime selection; `native/abilities/` owns C modules, guards, ABI, linker and dependency fingerprints; `tests/test_abilities.py` covers contracts; `scripts/verify_abilities.py` verifies native behavior. The SDK uses the existing single hook. Custom mechanics remain trusted native code, with transient RAM and no custom SRAM schema.

## E: custom content

See [CUSTOM-CONTENT.md](CUSTOM-CONTENT.md) for supported source formats, exact native item-icon bindings, per-asset provenance/hashes, PNG authoring, PCM import limits, test fixtures and agent workflows. `aria/content.py` and `examples/content-workshop` provide the working layer; `tests/test_content.py` and `scripts/verify_content.py` cover codecs, bindings and actual native rendering. Sound playback and arbitrary sprite/animation allocation remain future contracts.

## Named native resource milestone

[RESOURCE-AUTHORING.md](RESOURCE-AUTHORING.md) documents `aria/resources.py`, profile catalog, CLI export/diff, sparse tile/palette contracts, optional previews and new native examples/tests. [TOTAL-CONVERSIONS.md](TOTAL-CONVERSIONS.md) defines prerequisites and acceptance for room geometry, actors/animation, native audio, progression, campaign/save integration and release. This milestone adds native icon authoring, not a generic geometry/animation/audio engine.


## Room geometry foundation and project rename (2026-10-10)

The project is now **Tactical Soul Framework**, in its independent folder of the same name. Use `TacticalSoul.cmd`; `Dominance.cmd` and `Framework.cmd` remain aliases. See [rename compatibility](RENAMING.md) for environment variables and retained native ABI identifiers.

Read [ROOM-GEOMETRY.md](ROOM-GEOMETRY.md) before terrain work. `aria/compression.py` implements bounded LZ10/Aria resource reconstruction; `aria/geometry.py` inspects type-2 layers and applies checked, isolated existing-metatile edits. `inspect-geometry` and private `export-geometry` expose the source-backed format. `examples/geometry-workshop/mod.json` adds one stone step in the first hallway and composes the paired save-room route. Writes currently support only this registered main layer, unchanged dimensions and existing metatiles. New graphics, collision definitions, room resizing and full campaign compilation remain unimplemented.

Validation: 101 unit tests pass. `scripts/verify_geometry.py` passes eight structural/native checks: original walking reaches world X329, the edited step stops Soma at X311, native A jumping reaches X458, and fresh save/continue plus natural return stops at X360 on the other face. Initial comparisons declare a camera-relative X/zero-velocity fixture and retain settled Y; terrain is never injected into RAM. Private evidence stays in `local/geometry-verification.json`. See the geometry guide for format provenance, contracts, file responsibilities and next extensions.


## Static room previews and GUI editor goal

Read [ROOM-PREVIEWS.md](ROOM-PREVIEWS.md) for the implemented renderer, private PNG/atlas/report command, resource formats, API contracts and native evidence. `TacticalSoul.cmd preview-room 0 3 --out local/previews/hallway.png` works with bundled Python. Add `--mod examples/geometry-workshop/mod.json` to preview checked terrain edits. `aria/rendering.py` returns GUI-independent RGBA buffers; it does not modify ROM data. The atlas currently includes referenced metatiles only. Native checks match all eight graphics chunks, eight palette banks and 7,217 opaque wall pixels for baseline and edited rooms. The suite now has 111 tests.

[GUI-EDITOR-ROADMAP.md](GUI-EDITOR-ROADMAP.md) makes a graphical level editor an explicit goal and describes frontend/model boundaries, document/undo semantics, milestones and acceptance. No GUI, room catalog, layer compositor, complete brush catalog, inherited resources or 8bpp preview is implemented yet. Current source package: `release/Tactical-Soul-Framework-0.3.0.zip`. Update the inventory with `python scripts/update_inventory.py` before packaging. Native verification requires local development tools; normal previews do not.


## Room browser backend (v0.4)

[ROOM-CATALOG.md](ROOM-CATALOG.md) documents `aria/room_catalog.py` and `TacticalSoul.cmd room-catalog`: stable base-state slot IDs, bounded pagination, independent diagnostics and optional rendering checks. The shared room lookup now handles the final sector using the source-backed area-table end boundary. Full private audit covers 343 slots; twelve selected layers render. 122 unit tests pass. Catalog availability describes decoder support, not gameplay safety; terrain permissions are unchanged. Current source package: `release/Tactical-Soul-Framework-0.4.0.zip`. Next editor foundation: immutable editor documents and undo/redo, followed by a viewer frontend.


## Custom terrain and tracked completion (v0.5)

Read [CUSTOM-TERRAIN.md](CUSTOM-TERRAIN.md) for newly authored type-2 metatiles, explicit empty/solid collision, loaded-resource validation and isolated visual/collision streams. `examples/custom-terrain-workshop/mod.json` is runnable; `python scripts/verify_geometry.py --custom-terrain` verifies native pixels, walking, jumping, save/continue and return. All 127 unit tests pass. Original character/palette imports, VRAM allocation, other collision families and broader room writes remain unfinished.

[COMPLETION-ROADMAP.md](COMPLETION-ROADMAP.md) and `framework/roadmap.json` track the total-conversion scope and weighted maturity estimate (currently about 21%). A GUI application is deferred; work belongs in reusable framework APIs. At the end of every development turn, report progress/validation, next milestone and estimated framework completion. Next: original room graphics/palette imports with isolated load lists and explicit resource budgets. Current package: `release/Tactical-Soul-Framework-0.5.0.zip`.


## Original room artwork (v0.6)

[ROOM-ASSETS.md](ROOM-ASSETS.md) documents the registered original 4bpp/palette importer, isolated load lists, source/preimage guards, static VRAM/tilemap budgets and native evidence. `examples/original-room-art/mod.json` imports original neon-brick artwork and composes custom solid terrain with the save route. All 134 tests pass; native checks cover pixel identity, collision, jumping, fresh continue and exact resource reload on return. General VRAM ownership, other rooms, animation and death/pause/event coverage remain unfinished. Current package: `release/Tactical-Soul-Framework-0.6.0.zip`; tracked completion estimate is about 23%. Next: resource dependency/budget audits and broader native lifecycle support.


## Static dependencies and original-art lifecycle (v0.7)

[ROOM-RESOURCE-AUDIT.md](ROOM-RESOURCE-AUDIT.md) documents `audit-resources`, static all-metatile dependencies, budgets, narrow shared-list consumer scanning and the 343-slot survey. Unloaded memory observations are not import authorization. `python scripts/verify_geometry.py --room-art --lifecycle` adds verified native B pause cancellation, forced-HP death/Game Over and fresh continue from post-death SRAM with exact art reload on natural return. All 141 tests pass. No new writable/import room registrations were added. Current package: `release/Tactical-Soul-Framework-0.7.0.zip`; estimated weighted completion is about 24%. Next: resolve unsupported/inherited resources and validate another ordinary room before expanding permissions.


## Byte-index background inspection (v0.9.0)

See [BYTE-INDEX-BACKGROUNDS.md](BYTE-INDEX-BACKGROUNDS.md) for the separate read-only type-1/type-3 API and private lossless exports. All 24 native byte-index layers roundtrip; 149 tests pass. Rendering, collision semantics and write permissions remain pending. Existing type-2 consumers retain their contracts.


## Static background source rendering (v0.10.0)

See [BACKGROUND-RENDERING.md](BACKGROUND-RENDERING.md) for preview-background, 8bpp source APIs and native memory evidence. 153 tests; native character loads, declared palettes and a 1024-byte type-3 tilemap verified. Native viewport pixel matching remains unresolved; no new write permissions.
